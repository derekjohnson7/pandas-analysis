#Your report must include a written description of at
#least two observable trends based on the data.

1. Students that attend public schools tend to have lower grade averages in math
and reading scores(math substantially brings the overall passing average down
in public schools).

2. Interestingly enough, the less money that is spent (on a per student basis), the higher their passing rates
are. Conversely, the schools that spent the most money on their students had a lower passing rate.
